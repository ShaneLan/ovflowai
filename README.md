# :construction: Under Active Development

> Our focus is on establishing core functionality and essential features. As we continue to develop Omniplex, we are committed to implementing best practices, refining the codebase, and introducing new features to enhance the user experience.

# Get started

We are working on the documentation to help you get started with building plugins and addons. For now, to run the project, modify the code in the Chat component to use the `// Development Code`.

## Disclaimer
